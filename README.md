Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizes data distributions and relationships using scatter plots, histograms, pair plots, and heatmaps.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Trains multiple classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, MLP).

Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualizes performance using confusion matrices.

Voting Classifier:

Combines predictions from multiple classifiers to improve accuracy.

Visualization:

Provides insights into the dataset and model performance through various plots (e.g., scatter plots, box plots, violin plots).
